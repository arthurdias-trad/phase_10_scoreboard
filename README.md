# Phase 10 Score Tracker
<br><br>
This is a simple program to compute Phase 10 scores for a two-player match, where the players or dealer enter who won the round and what cards the losing player still has. The program keeps track of the current phases and rounds and tallies up the scores for both players. The program writes the result down on a .txt file with the date of the game.
